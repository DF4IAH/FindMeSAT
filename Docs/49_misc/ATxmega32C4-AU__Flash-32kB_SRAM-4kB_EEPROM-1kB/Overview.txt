OVERVIEW

The high-performance, 
low-power 
8/16-bit AVR XMEGA microcontroller combines 
32KB in-system programmable flash memory (4KB boot code section) with read-while-write capabilities, 
1KB EEPROM, 
4KB SRAM, 
four-channel event system, 
a programmable multi-level interrupt controller, 
34 general purpose I/O lines, 
a 16-bit real time counter, 
four flexible 16-bit timer/counters with capture, compare 
and PWM channels, 
USB Full-speed Device, 
two USARTs, 
two Two-Wire Interfaces (TWIs) I2C, 
two Serial Peripheral Interfaces (SPIs), 
one 12-channel/12-bit ADC with programmable gain, 
two analog comparators with window mode, 
a programmable watchdog timer with separate internal oscillator, 
accurate internal oscillators with PLL and prescaler, 
and programmable brown-out detection.
