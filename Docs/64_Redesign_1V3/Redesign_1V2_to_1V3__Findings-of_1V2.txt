==================================================
List of Corrections to be done for  V1.2 —> V1.3
==================================================

				Update: 2017-08-17

01)	Inspection of V1.2 showed that the PWM low pass filter frequency
	is to high. Instead of 100 Hz the new frequency is set to 1 Hz.
	For this C1001 changed from 100 nF to 10 µF. The device changed
	from SMD0603 to SMD0805.

02)	The USB-socket shows bad designed long-holes. This time these are
	not cut out. The sockets have to be reworked before placement for
	work-around. I suggest hand written XML code within the Eagle brd
	file to have a correct long-hole like in some devices found in the
	library.

03)	All version numbers to V1.3

04)	A level-shifter between ATxmega and SIM808 is needed due to
	different supply voltages. See SIM808 serial documentation for
	this.

05)	GSM antenna needs to be tuned in length, again. Bluetooth seems
	to be OK. More to be investigated.


06)	USB Polyfuse modified from 0.5A/1.0A to 1.1A/2.2A to be able to
	charge the LiPo battery.


07)	Missing ground connections for the SIM808 added (3x).
