==================================================
List of Corrections to be done for  V1.0 —> V1.1
==================================================

				Update: 2017-02-16

Inspection of V1.0 showed that a short circuit between
the two internal layers GND and 3.3V renders the V1.0
useless due to misplaced layers stack.

00)	All version numbers to V1.1 —> Done.

01)	Increase Clearance to Pads and Via to 0.30mm, or
	0.35mm if feasible. —> Settings done. Redesign still to do.

02)	Do not generate Thermals for Vias.  —> Done.

03)	Take Antennas more away from their edges, at least 2mm. —> Done.

04)	Place text for the antennas to the bottom (solder) side. —> Done.

05)	Move internal text block of the board name more left to stand alone. —> Done.

06)	USB-connector: Reduce outline on tDoc layer. —> Done.

07)	USB-connector: use greater size for restring of long hole. —> Done, minor tweaks also.

08)	Place headers more distant to each other.

09)	Color: use red instead of blue for stop mask.

10)	Place name on tName/bName more distant to the devices. —> Done.

11)	Test keepout areas for all plated holes. / Check with gerber inspection for
	clearance. —> Not needed, use 01) instead.

12)	Adjust staple of layers to new core thickness = 0.88mm. —> Done.

13)	Add four fiducials. —> Done. 

14)	Add three inspection windows: 4-layered rings with decreasing radius and
	„rotating axis“. Each layer this axis is turned 45 deg left. —> Not needed, use 13) instead.

15)	tNames/bNames increase size: —> Repositioned, but left at 0.61mm due to having no problem with that.
	- minimum character width (spacing): 0.15mm
	- minimum character height: 0.80mm

16)	SIM808 pin placement 0.4mm to center. —> Done.

17)	Add Keepout areas for the antenna delivery arms. —> Done.

18)	SIM card holder move more to the center. —> Done.

19)	USB connector move more to the center. —> Done.

20)	Shrink package of 16MHz crystal. —> Done.

21)	Adjust all ICs placement drawings to 0.254mm. —> Done.
